# Pond Temp Sender
Raspberry Pico Temp sender for a pond or any other environment using the required DS18x20 hardware.
This build uses UDP broadcasting as a method of communication. 

Although this approach works really well it is being retired and API request based approach is currently in development. 
An API will provide greater client side freedom.
